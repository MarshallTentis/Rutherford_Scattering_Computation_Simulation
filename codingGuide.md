# Guide for Simulation Development

Hi Marshal,

Here are some ideas for coding the simulation. Please consider these as suggestions; they might not be the most effective approach, and there could be better ways to implement this.

Given that this is a simulation, employing classes for each component would be beneficial. If you're unfamiliar with classes or object-oriented programming in Python, I recommend reviewing those concepts, as they represent an important technique.

I suggest creating two classes: one for the alpha particle and another for the gold nucleus.

The `AlphaParticle` class should contain the following attributes:

* `mass`
* `position`
* `angular_position`
* `initial_velocity` (given)
* `force`
* `velocity`
* `acceleration`

It should also have the following methods:

* `get_distance()`
* `update_position()`
* `update_velocity()`
* `update_acceleration()`
* `update_force()`

These methods should be implemented based on the differential equations provided in the assignment materials.

For the `GoldNucleus` class, we can consider it stationary, so the following attributes should suffice for now:

* `position`
* `charge`

Next, you'll need a separate file for the simulation itself.

Here's a suggested workflow:

1.  **Initialization:** Instantiate the `AlphaParticle` and `GoldNucleus` objects.
2.  **Simulation Loop:** Create a `for` loop that iterates over discrete time steps. Within the loop, for each time step (`dt`), call the `update_position()`, `update_velocity()`, `update_acceleration()`, and `update_force()` methods of the `AlphaParticle` object.
3.  **Data Output:** Record the state of the simulation (e.g., position, velocity) at each time step. You can write this data to a CSV file. The Pandas library can simplify writing data to CSV files; however, if you find Pandas too complex to learn at this stage, you can achieve the same result using Python's built-in file read/write capabilities.

Finally, after the simulation completes, you can use the generated CSV data to plot the trajectory of the alpha particle.

Remember, it's perfectly acceptable to use AI tools to assist with coding, as this project provides excellent coding practice!

Good luck, Marshal!


# original Guide that's a bit confusing 
Hi marshal, there are some ideas for coding, hope this helps, any thing I provide here are just suggestions so they might not help and there might be better ways. 

since this is simulation, having classes for each components of the simulation would help. If you don't understand what a class is or how to use object oriented programming in python, you should look it up, it's an important techinque.

two class, a class for alpha particle, and a class for gold nucleus,
the alpha particle should contains fields of mass, position, angular position, initial_velocity(given), force, velocity, and accelration.
For it's methods should have:
  get distance
  update position, 
  update velocity,
  update accelration,
  update force, 

and they should be described from the differential equations given in the material.

for gold nucleus class, we consider it as stationary, so just position and charge would be enough at the moment. 

Then another file for simulation,
first initialize the alpha particle and the gold nucleus. 
second, create a for loop for set time steps of simulation, and in the loop, for each dt(that we set), updates the position, velocity, accelration, force of the moving particle. and output each frame into a csv, the library Pandas makes data writing to csv a lot easier, but if it's too confusing to learn, it can be achieve in python with simple read write document as well. 
finally with the simutaion end, we can plot out the movement of the alpha particle using the generated csv. 

like in real life, don't feel bad to let AI write some of it, this will be a very good coding pratice! Good luck marshal.
